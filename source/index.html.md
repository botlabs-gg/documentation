# Introduction

Weeb.sh is a service for bot developers
that wants to simplify the development and continued hosting of difficult features
like reaction images, image generation, bot settings and user reputation (gamification)

To accomplish that,
weeb.sh provides a number of APIs
which allow the bot developers to easily implement those features into their bots.
